# IITKPlacementStats
This is the full  stack web development project, which basically consists of 4 options i.e., POST( post the placement record), GET( get the placement record), DELETE( delete the placement record), and UPDATE( update the record). I used Spring boot framework, spring MVC, REST API , HTML, CSS,  and basics of javascript. For deployment of spring boot application, I used google cloud appengine.
